## RCloud search

RCloud can optionally index all notebooks and provide a search
capability. It currently requires Apache Solr.

The script `solrsetup.sh` can be used to help with the setup
of a Solr instance. Example use:

    sh solrsetup.sh /data/rcloud/solr

It will fetch and install Solr and configure it to contain the
schema suitable for RCloud use. It is enabled in rcloud by using
the `solr.url` directive that points to the Solr API - see the
output of the above script.
