RCloud 0.9.2 beta release
-----------------------

Requirements:
 - R 3.0.0 or higher
 - development files for the folllowing libraries:
   Xt, cairographics, cURL, readline

On Ubuntu you can use
   sudo apt-get install libxt-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libcairo2-dev libreadline-dev

On MacOS X no dependencies are needed if you use CRAN package binaries, otherwise
install XQuartz from http://xquartz.macosforge.org and libcairo+libreadline

INSTALLATION
-------------

This release package contains a copy of all direct dependencies, so to bootstrap
all necessary packages from sources use

sh bootstrapR.sh

in the RCloud root. Once that completes successfully, edit github.client.id and
github.client.secret entries in

conf/rcloud.conf

to match the application in Github you have created (refer to
"Github authentication" in https://github.com/att/rcloud/blob/develop/README.md)
Once that is done, you can start up the server using

conf/start
